Did you get all that? Let's check with a quick question!
Why do we need to learn the syntax and semantics of a programming language?

To be able to easily switch to a different programming language

So that we know which part is the subject and which one is the predicate

To allow us to clearly express what we want the computer to do

To understand why our computer crashes


Correct
You nailed it! Knowing the syntax and understanding the semantics of a programming language allows us to tell the computer what we want it to do.
